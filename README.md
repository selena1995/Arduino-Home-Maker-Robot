I have made an Arduino Robot for house hold activities. This one can deliver any items like food, medicines, water, cell phone. clothes and many more things for one place to another.
## Story
Here in this instructable, I have made an Arduino Robot for house hold activities. This one can deliver any items like food, medicines, water, cell phone. clothes and many more things for one place to another. This is useful for those who work alone and have to manage the whole things in a short period of time. To make it simple, I have made it small in size and light in weight. But this could be modified according to your need. A big size and heavy weight robot could carry heavy things which will be more useful. Besides this article, I have also made a video on this robot which will help you for better understanding.

## Why Automatic/Robot Home Maker Is Needed
There have so many robots are already available in the market who can clean the home, provides security protections, entertains people and many more. In case of my one, it is specialized in working side by side a person like other person works. Like, if you are cooking but on the same time you have to send a cup of tea to someone else, then the robot will carry the cup of tea to the other person. This will reduce work stress by working with a person. This will also use in hotels and restaurants in replacements of waiters.

## PARTS OF THE PROJECT
To make and understand it easily we have splatted this project into two main parts.

MECHANICAL Part
ELECTRONICS Part
for better explanation we have divided our ELECTRONICS Part into

Circuit and PCB
Assemble the electronics components
ARDUINO coding
