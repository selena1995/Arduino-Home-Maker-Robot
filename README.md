## Story
Here in this instructable, I have made an Arduino Robot for house hold activities. This one can deliver any items like food, medicines, water, cell phone. clothes and many more things for one place to another. This is useful for those who work alone and have to manage the whole things in a short period of time. To make it simple, I have made it small in size and light in weight. But this could be modified according to your need. A big size and heavy weight robot could carry heavy things which will be more useful. Besides this article, I have also made a video on this robot which will help you for better understanding.
